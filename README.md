## About:

Sudoku Explainer (Nicolas Juillerat 2006-2019) is a popular Sudoku solver/generator/rater which solves every known Sudoku
puzzle using logical techniques. This popularity and consistency was the basis of the [Patterns game](http://forum.enjoysudoku.com/patterns-game-1-5-t5760.html) on
the &quot;New Sudoku Players Forum&quot;. It was further modified to incorporate &quot;serate&quot; which allowed
the explainer rating (ER), the pearl rating (EP) and he diamond rating (ED).

Pencilmark Sudoku (Sukaku) is the normal extension of Sudoku and [Sukaku Explainer was developed](http://forum.enjoysudoku.com/help-with-sudoku-explainer-t6677-60.html) based
on the serate modification of Sudoku explainer
